Create the Missing Directory: Ensure that the directory /var/cache/jenkins/war/META-INF/ exists. If it doesn't, you can create it manually:

bash
Copy code
sudo mkdir -p /var/cache/jenkins/war/META-INF/
Set Correct Permissions: Make sure the directory and its parent directories have the correct permissions for Jenkins to access them:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/cache/jenkins/
Replace jenkins:jenkins with the appropriate user and group if Jenkins uses different ones on your system.

Restart Jenkins: After creating the directory and setting the correct permissions, try restarting Jenkins:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
